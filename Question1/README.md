How to run Question 1

Arithmetic Operations and Fibonacci Calculation using Dynamic Programming

Development Environment:
- Language: C
- Compiler: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC)

How to Compile and Run:
1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code (main.c) using the 'cd' command: cd /path/to/source/code

3. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC): gcc -o arithmetic_fibonacci question1.c

4. Run the compiled executable: ./arithmetic_fibonacci

5. The program will execute the defined arithmetic operations and calculate Fibonacci numbers based on the provided expressions. The results will be displayed in the terminal.

Note: Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or an equivalent compiler for your platform.
