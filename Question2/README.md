How to run Question 2

Solving Recurrence Relation F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n-2)

Development Environment:
- Language: C
- Compiler: Any C compiler (e.g., GCC)

How to Compile and Run:
1. Open a text editor and paste the desired approach code from below.

2. Save the code in a file with a ".c" extension, for example: `recursive.c` or`memoization.c` or`bottomup.c` .

3. Open a terminal window.

4. Navigate to the directory containing the saved source code file using the 'cd' command: cd /path/to/source/code


5. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
gcc -o recurrence_solution recursive.c or memoization.c or bottomup.c 


6. Run the compiled executable:
./recurrence_solution


7. The program will execute the solution for the recurrence relation and display the calculated result for the given value of 'n'.

Note: Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or an equivalent compiler for your platform.
